#About the project 

This python code simulates a stochastic, individual-based birth-and-death process (e.g. M ́el ́eard, 2016; Otto and Day, 2011), to study the evolution of daily periods of mate searching activity within
species, and its potential effect on population divergence and speciation.

If you wish to run it using the multiprocessing feature, a linux build is recommanded.
